### Independent-particle approximation

Each electron moves in the field of the nucleus and the average distribution of the other $Z-1$ electrons

- **IPA potential energy**: $U(r)=-Z_{eff}(r)ke^2/r$<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1094676554652602419/1100826809605566522/image.png" alt="diagram" width="220" align="right"/>
- **Z effective**: $Z_{eff}\to Z$ as $r\to 0$, and $Z_{eff}\to 1$ as $r\to \infty$
- **Energy levels**:

### Pauli exclusion principle

No two electrons can occupy the same quantum state (no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of quantum numbers)

### Bosons and fermions

- **Bosons**: symmetric multiparticle wave functions, do not obey the Pauli principle. Eg: photon
- **Fermions**: antisymmetric multiparticle wave functions, obey the Pauli principle. Eg: proton, neuron, electron

### Electron configuration

shown as superscripts
_Special cases_:

- Chromium (Cr), atomic number 24: $[Ar]4s^13d^5$ (half-filled d orbitals ($d^5$) are more stable than partially-filled orbitals ($d^4$))
- Copper (Cu), atomic number 29: $[Ar]4s^13d^10$ (a completely filled d orbital ($d^10$) is more stable than a partially-filled orbital ($d^9$))

### Periodic behavior

- **Atomic size (radius)**: Atomic size generally **decreases from left to right** across a period and **increases from top to bottom** within a group. This is due to increasing nuclear charge (protons) and increasing energy levels (shells) respectively.

- **Ionization energy**: Ionization energy is the **energy required to remove an electron** from an atom. It generally **increases from left to right** across a period and **decreases from top to bottom within a group**. This is because of the increasing effective nuclear charge and decreasing atomic size.

- **Electron affinity**: Electron affinity is the **energy released when an atom gains an electron**. It generally **increases from left to right** across a period and **decreases from top to bottom** within a group. This is due to the increasing effective nuclear charge and decreasing atomic size.

- **Electronegativity**: Electronegativity is the ability of an atom to **attract electrons in a chemical bond**. It generally **increases from left to right** across a period and **decreases from top to bottom** within a group. This is due to the increasing effective nuclear charge and decreasing atomic size.
