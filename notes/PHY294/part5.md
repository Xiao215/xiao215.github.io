### Ideal Gas

Ideal gas law ($P=$ pressure, $V=$ volume, $n=$ number of moles of gas, $R=8.31\frac{J}{mol\cdot K}$, $T=$ temperature):
$$PV=nRT$$
For $N=$ number of molecules, $N_A=$ Avogadro's Number $6.02\times 10^{23}$, $k=$ Boltzmann's constant:

$$
N=n\times N_A\\
PV=NkT\\
nR=Nk
$$

### Equipartition of Energy

- Degree of freedom: number of forms of energy for which the formula is a quadratic function of a coordinate or velocity component.
- DoF example:
  - $\frac{1}{2}mv_x^2,\frac{1}{2}mv_y^2,\frac{1}{2}mv_z^2,\frac{1}{2}I\omega_x^2,\frac{1}{2}I\omega_x^2,\frac{1}{2}k_sx^2, etc$
  - 3 translational kinetic energy, 2 rotational kinetic energy and 1 elastic potential energy.
- **Equipartition Theorem**: For each DoF, the average energy is $\frac{1}{2}kT$ (translational and rotational), while $kT$ (elastical):

### Heat and Work

- $U$: total energy of the system
- $Q$: flow of energy from one object to another due to difference in temperature
- $W$: any other transfer of energy in and out of system. **W is positive when work enters the system.** **Compression** $\Rightarrow$ **Positive Work**
  $$W=-\int_{V_i}^{V_f} P(V) dV=-(V_f-V_i)P$$

### Heat Capacities

- Heat capacity is the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature up by one degree.
  Heat Capacity at constant volume:
  $$C_V\equiv\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial f}\right)_V$$
- Heat Capacity at constant pressure:
  $$C_P\equiv\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial f}\right)_P+P\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial f}\right)_P$$
