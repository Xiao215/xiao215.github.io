### Interatomic bonds

- **the ionic bond**: attraction between oppositely charged ions
- **the covalent bond**: sharing of electrons between atoms
- **the hydrogen bond**: bond between hydrogen and electronegative atoms
- **the van der Waals bond**: bond due to temporary fluctuations in electron density
- **the metallic bond**: between metal atoms due to delocalized electrons

### Dipole moment $p$

Dipole moment between two equal but opposite charges is $p=qd$ where $q$ is magnitude of either charge and $d$ is their separation

### Ionic bond

The net cost of energy for NaCl is:
$$\Delta E = IE(Na) - EA(Cl) = 5.1eV - 3.6eV = 1.5eV$$

### Covalent bond

- $H_2^+$ ion:
  - Bonding orbital: Probability Density Function: $\psi_+$, Energy: $E_+(R)$
  - Antibonding orbital: Probability Density Function: $\psi_-$, Energy: $E_-(R)$

### Molecular Orbital (MO) Diagram

- Bonding orbitals are lower in energy and more stable than antibonding orbitals, which are higher in energy and less stable.
- Electrons fill molecular orbitals according to the Aufbau principle (from lower to higher energy) and follow Hund's rule (maximizing unpaired electrons in degenerate orbitals before pairing up).
- The bond order indicates the stability of a molecule. It is calculated as (number of electrons in bonding orbitals - number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2.

### Hybridization of Orbital

1. Draw the Lewis structure of the molecule
2. Count the number of electron domains around the central atom:
   - **lone pairs of electrons**
   - **single bonds**
   - **double bonds**
   - **triple bonds**
3. Determine the hybridization based on the number of electron domains:
   Number of electron domains $\to$ 2: $sp$, 3: $sp2$, 4: $sp3$, 5: $sp3d$, 6: $sp3d2$
