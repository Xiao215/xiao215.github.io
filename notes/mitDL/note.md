3. when Pepsi do the challange

- High Consumption: Consumption of Carbonated Soft Drinks (CSDs) increased significantly over the decades, growing at an average of 3% per year. Americans were consuming more soda than any other beverage, even with numerous alternatives available.

- Market Dominance: Both companies had a considerable share in the CSD market. Coca-Cola and Pepsi maintained a dominant position in the industry and competed aggressively for market share.

- Innovative Marketing: Both companies invested heavily in advertising and innovative marketing strategies. Pepsi's "Pepsi Generation" campaign and Coke's lifestyle advertising emphasized the role that the beverages played in consumers' lives.

- Introduction of New Products: Over the years, both companies diversified their product range with the introduction of diet and flavored varieties of their CSDs. This helped to attract a wider range of consumers and contributed to their profitability.

- Strong Distribution Networks: Both companies built extensive distribution networks. They created a bottling franchise system that expanded their reach nationally and internationally.

- Strategic Pricing: The companies' pricing strategies also contributed to their success. For instance, Pepsi initially priced its concentrate 20% lower than Coke, which helped gain market share. In the 1970s, it increased its concentrate prices to match Coke's, promising to invest the additional revenue in advertising and promotion.

- Diversification: Both companies diversified into non-CSD industries. Coke acquired companies in the fruit juice, coffee, tea, and water industries. Pepsi merged with snack-food giant Frito-Lay to form PepsiCo.

- International Expansion: Both companies expanded internationally, taking advantage of global markets. Coke's international business grew during World War II, and Pepsi doubled its U.S. share between 1950 and 1970.

2.  Apply the Five Forces Model, how strong as the industryâ€™s
    competitive forces if you are looking at it from the
    perspective of the bottler? Is this an attractive industry to
    participate in?

    - **Threat of New Entrants (Low)**:
      The bottling industry is highly capital-intensive, requiring substantial investment in manufacturing facilities, production lines, trucks, and distribution networks. The high entry costs, along with the need to establish strong relationships with concentrate producers and retail channels, serve as significant barriers to new entrants. Furthermore, the industry is dominated by large, established players like Coca-Cola and Pepsi, making it difficult for new companies to gain a foothold.

    - **Threat of Substitute Products or Services (Medium-High)**:
      The health-conscious trend among consumers has led to an increased demand for healthier beverage alternatives, such as fruit juices, bottled water, and herbal teas. This presents a significant threat to the CSD industry, including bottlers. However, the strong brand identities and consumer loyalty towards major CSD brands like Coca-Cola and Pepsi mitigate this threat to some extent.

    - **Bargaining Power of Customers (Medium)**:
      The power of customers is medium in this industry. Retailers, especially large chains like Wal-Mart, can exert significant pressure on prices and demand promotional support. However, the high demand for popular CSD brands, along with the variety of retail channels (supermarkets, vending machines, fountain outlets, etc.), somewhat balances this power.

    - **Bargaining Power of Suppliers (Low-Medium)**:
      The suppliers for the bottling industry include the concentrate producers and packaging suppliers. Major concentrate producers, particularly Coca-Cola and Pepsi, have a significant influence over bottlers due to their dominant market positions and the critical nature of their product. However, the existence of franchise agreements and the need for concentrate producers to maintain a healthy bottler network limit their bargaining power. On the other hand, the bargaining power of packaging suppliers is relatively low due to the availability of multiple suppliers and long-term relationships established by the bottlers.

    - **Competitive Rivalry Among Existing Firms (High)**:
      The rivalry among existing bottlers is intense, primarily driven by the fierce competition between the two industry giants, Coca-Cola and Pepsi. Bottlers are constantly competing for shelf space, retail accounts, and consumer preference, which leads to high advertising and promotional expenses.

3.  How can Coke & Pepsi sustain their profits with increasing
    globalization, flattening demand and the growing popularity
    of non-CDS?

- **Adapting to Changing Consumer Preferences**: As health concerns related to high sugar content in CSDs grew, these companies started innovating. Coke introduced the Freestyle soda machine, which could create various types of custom beverages. Pepsi redesigned its logo and rebranded itself to rejuvenate its image.

- **Diversification**: Both companies expanded their product mix to offer alternatives to traditional CSDs. This included diet sodas, alternatives with natural sweeteners, and other "non-carbs" such as juices, juice drinks, sports drinks, energy drinks, tea-based drinks, and bottled water. This diversified product portfolio allowed them to cater to a wider audience with different preferences.

- **International Expansion**: With softening demand for CSDs in the U.S., Coke and Pepsi looked abroad for new growth opportunities. They focused on emerging markets like China and India, with growing middle-class populations, and tailored their offerings to local tastes.

- **Structural and Strategic Evolution**: The companies adapted their production and distribution practices to accommodate the growing popularity of alternative beverages. This included getting more directly involved in manufacturing non-CSDs and navigating new challenges associated with distributing a wider range of products.

- **Bottler Consolidation**: Both Pepsi and Coke made moves to consolidate their bottling operations, which helped streamline operations and increase control over their supply chains. For instance, Pepsi announced in 2009 that it would buy two of its biggest bottlers, which would consolidate more than 80% of its North American beverage operations under one roof.

4. The production and distribution of Carbonated Soft Drinks (CSDs) involve four key players: concentrate producers, bottlers, retail channels, and suppliers.

- **Concentrate Producers**: Concentrate producers blend raw materials, package the mix in containers, and ship them to bottlers. The production process is not capital-intensive. Major costs include advertising, promotion, and market research. Concentrate producers often lead in developing marketing programs and negotiating with retailers. They also work closely with bottlers, providing sales support and negotiating with suppliers. The U.S. CSD market is dominated by Coke and Pepsi, which together held a 72% share in 2009.

- **Bottlers**: Bottlers buy concentrate, add carbonated water and sweeteners, package the product, and deliver it to customers. The bottling process is capital-intensive, requiring large investments in production lines and distribution networks. Despite high gross profits, operating margins are typically around 8%. The number of U.S. bottlers has decreased from over 2,000 in 1970 to fewer than 300 in 2009. Franchise agreements give bottlers the right to distribute products in exclusive geographic territories.

- **Retail Channels**: In 2009, distribution of CSDs in the U.S. took place through a variety of channels including supermarkets, fountain outlets, vending machines, mass merchandisers, and convenience stores. Each channel has varying costs and profitability depending on factors like delivery methods, advertising, and marketing. Retailers often have their own private-label CSDs, which are delivered to their warehouses, incurring additional costs.

- **Suppliers**: Suppliers provide the inputs for concentrate production and bottling, such as caramel coloring, acids, natural flavors, caffeine, packaging materials, and sweeteners. Coke and Pepsi negotiate on behalf of their bottling networks with major suppliers to ensure stable long-term relationships.
